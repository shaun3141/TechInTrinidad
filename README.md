# Tech In Trinidad

Hey there :wave: 

This is the source code powering [https://www.techintrinidad.com](www.TechInTrinidad.com)

You can see the exact code and files that are used on the website, and if you'd like to improve it, I'd welcome that.

## How it Works

This website follows the standard setup and best practices of the popular web framework, [https://nextjs.org/](next.js)

There is a `readme.md` file in the `techintrinidad` folder for running the website locally.

It uses the [Material UI React Framework](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview).

The website is deployed on Vercel. 

There is no API or back-end powering this website today, but feel free to add some cool stuff!

## Have an idea but not sure how to do it?

Get in touch with *techintrinidad@gmail.com* and I can either help you figure out how to make the change, or make it on your behalf.
